            <h2>ABOUT ME </h2>
            <p> Hi there, thanks for visiting my webpage.
                My name is Roxana and I'm
                20 years old. At the present, I'm a student at the
                Faculty of Automation, Computers, and Electronics - Multimedia Systems Engineering. I'm a happy,
                ambitious, energic person who wants to be beyond her limits. I don't have experience in
                websites,
                web design, Photoshop, Illustrator, UI, or UX, I'm a beginner. This site was the first site
                created by me. I want to know more about all these things because I am passionate about them.
                The
                purpose of this site was to add tutorials that I went through at one point and they helped me get
                over certain obstacles, to make it much easier for me to find them. I also wanted to add different
                sites or images that inspired my design.
            </p>
